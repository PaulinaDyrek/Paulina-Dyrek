## Hi! My name is Paulina Dyrek. 
For 1.5 years I have decided to change my job and profession to the 
position of Frontend Developer. Since I have devoted every moment to
learning and participating in online courses. On this courses I am doing a
lot of excercices. Working in my current position as a civil servant forced
me to change my career because it doesn't bring me satisfaction and
doesn't give me the opportunity to develop. I am still working 
to improve my frontend knowledge and build a portfolio. 
I want developing my skills as a junior frontend developer. I am an
ambitious person. I learn very quickly. I am open to gaining knowledge and
achieving goals. I am a task oriented, goal oriented and able to work under
time pressure. In my free time I like cycling and mountain trip .
